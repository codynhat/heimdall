    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and
        managing BGP, including protocol, policy, and operational
        aspects based on carrier and content provider operational
        requirements.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>This document describes a <xref target="RFC6020">YANG</xref>
      data model for <xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref> protocol and policy
      configuration, as well as defining key operational state data.
      The model is intended to be vendor-neutral, in order to allow
      operators to manage BGP configuration in heterogeneous
      environments with routers supplied by multiple vendors.  The
      model is also intended to be readily mapped to existing
      implementations, however, to facilitate support from as large a
      set of routing hardware and software vendors as possible.
      </t>
      <section title = "Goals and approach" anchor="goals">
        <t>This model does not (in the current iteration) aim to be
        feature complete (i.e., cover all possible features of a BGP
        implementation).  Rather its development is driven by
        examination of BGP configurations in use across a number of
        operator network deployments.
	     </t>

       <t>The focus area of the first version of the model is on base
       BGP protocol configuration and policy configuration with
       "hooks" to add support for additional address families, as well
       as operational data to enable a common model for reading
       BGP-related state from devices.
        </t>

      	<t>Configuration items that are deemed to be widely available
      	in existing major BGP implementations are included in the
      	model.  Those configuration items that are only available from
      	a single implementation are omitted from the model with the
      	expectation they will be available in companion modules that
      	augment the current model.  This allows clarity in identifying
      	data that is part of the vendor-neutral model.
      	</t>

        <t>Where possible, naming in the model follows conventions
        used in available standards documents, and otherwise tries to
        be self-explanatory with sufficient descriptions of the
        intended behavior.  Similarly, configuration data value
        constraints and default values, where used, are based on
        recommendations in current standards documentation.  Since
        implementations vary widely in this respect, this version of
        the model specifies only a limited set of defaults and ranges
        with the expectation of being more prescriptive in future
        versions based on actual operator use.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Model overview" anchor="overview">
      <t>The BGP model is defined across several YANG modules but at a
      high level is organized into three main parts:
      </t>
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t> protocol configuration -- configuration affecting BGP
            protocol-related operations, defined at various levels
            of hierarchy.
          </t>
          <t> policy configuration -- configuration defining the
            policies that act on routes sent (received) to (from)
            peers or other routing protocols.
          </t>
          <t> operational state -- variables used for monitoring,
            management, etc. of BGP operations.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        These modules also make use of the standard Internet types, such as IP addresses, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in <xref target="RFC6991">RFC 6991</xref>.
      </t>
        <section title="BGP protocol configuration"
          anchor="overview.protocol">
          <t>The BGP protocol configuration model is organized
            hierarchically, much like the majority of router
            implementations.  That is, configuration items can be
            specified at multiple levels, as shown below.
          </t>
          <figure>
            <artwork>

      +--rw global
      +--rw afi* [afi-name]
      +--rw peer-group* [group-name]
      +--rw neighbor* [neighbor-address]
      +--rw policy
            </artwork>
          </figure>
          <t> Users may specify configuration at a higher level and
            have it apply to all lower-level items, or provide
            overriding configuration at a lower level of the
            hierarchy.  Overriding configuration items are optional.
          </t>
          <t>The model makes the simplifying assumption that most of
          the configuration items are available at all levels of the
          hierarchy.  That is, very little configuration is specific
          to a particular level in the hierarchy, other than obvious
          items such as "group- name" only being available for the
          peer group-level config.  A notable exception is for
          sub-address family configuration where some items are only
          applicable for a given AFI-SAFI combination.
          </t>
	  <t>The initial version of the model includes placeholders
	  (i.e., mount points) for configuring different address
	  family or sub address family (AFI/SAFI) combinations in
	  support of <xref target="RFC4760">BGP multiprotocol
	  extensions</xref>.  The focus, however, is on base IPv4 and
	  IPv6 configuration, with later versions of the model
	  providing additional configuration for specific AFI/SAFI
	  types.  The current scope of AFI/SAFI combinations is
	  indicated below.  Each of the subtrees are containers for
	  configuration specific to the corresponding AFI-SAFI
	  combination.

        <section title="Policy configuration overview"
          anchor="overview.policy">
          <t>The BGP policy configuration model is based on a
            condition-action model in which policies are expressed as
            a series of conditions, each with a corresponding action.
            Conditions include testing for membership in a predefined
            set (e.g., community attribute matches a predefined set
            of communities), or testing route attributes for specified
            values.  Actions support setting specific attributes on a
            route or performing a control flow operation such as 
            accepting or rejecting a route, or going to the next
            policy.
          </t>
	  <t>The general structure of policy definitions, policy
	  statements, and condition-action policy rules is shown
	  below.
	  </t>
	  <figure>
	    <artwork>

                  +--rw actions
	    </artwork>
	  </figure>
	  <t>The policy model supports policy subroutines
	  through the use of the condition statement call-policy which
	  applies the conditions from another named policy
	  definition.  It also supports policy chaining using the
	  action statements goto-next and  goto-policy, which allow
	  policy evaluation to immediately move to the next policy
	  statement in the current policy definition, or move to
	  another named policy definition, respectively.  Using
	  multiple policy statements in a policy definition is also a
	  form of policy chaining which will evaluate each policy
	  statement in turn.

        <section title="Operational data overview"
          anchor="overview.operational">
	  <t>The BGP operational data model contains an initial set of
	  state variable definitions that would be required in most
	  service provider deployments for management, monitoring, and
	  fault detection.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      
      <t>BGP configuration has a significant impact on network operations,
      and as such any related protocol or model carries potential
      security risks.
      </t>

      <t>YANG data models are generally designed to be used with the
      NETCONF protocol over an SSH transport.  This provides an
      authenticated and secure channel over which to transfer BGP
      configuration and operational data.  Note that use of
      alternate transport or data encoding (e.g., JSON over HTTPS)
      would require similar mechanisms for authenticating and
      securing access to configuration data.
      </t>

      <t>Most of the data elements in the configuration model could be
      considered sensitive from a security standpoint.  Unauthorized
      access or invalid data could cause major disruption.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">

      <t>This YANG data model and the component modules currently use
      a temporary ad-hoc namespace.  If and when it is placed on redirected for
      the standards track, an appropriate namespace URI will be
      registered in the <xref target="RFC3688">IETF XML Registry"</xref>.  The BGP YANG
      modules will be registered in the "YANG Module Names" registry
      [RFC6020].

      <t>The modules comprising the BGP configuration and
      operational model are described by the YANG modules in the
