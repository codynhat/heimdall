1.  Introduction

   This document describes a YANG [RFC6020] data model for MPLS and
   traffic engineering, covering label switched path (LSP)
   configuration, as well as signaling protocol configuration.  The
   model is intended to be vendor-neutral, in order to allow operators
   to manage MPLS in heterogeneous environments with routers supplied by
   multiple vendors.  The model is also intended to be readily mapped to
   existing implementations, however, to facilitate support from as
   large a set of routing hardware and software vendors as possible.

1.1.  Goals and approach

   The focus area of the first version of the model is to set forth a
   framework for MPLS, with hooks into which information specific to
   various signaling-protocols can be added.  The framework is built
   around functionality from a network operator perspective rather than
   a signaling protocol-centric approach.  For example, a traffic-
   engineered LSP will have configuration relating to its path
   computation method, regardless of whether it is signaled with RSVP-TE
   or with segment routing.  Thus, rather than creating separate per-
   signaling protocol models and trying to stitch them under a common
   umbrella, this framework focuses on functionality, and adds
   siginaling protocol-specific information under it where applicable.

   This model does not (in the current iteration) aim to be feature
   complete (i.e., cover all possible aspects or features of MPLS).
   Rather its development is driven by examination of actual production
   configurations in use across a number of operator network
   deployments.

   Configuration items that are deemed to be widely available in
   existing major implementations are included in the model.  Those
   configuration items that are only available from a single
   implementation are omitted from the model with the expectation they
   will be available in companion modules that augment the current
   model.  This allows clarity in identifying data that is part of the
   vendor-neutral model.

   Where possible, naming in the model follows conventions used in
   available standards documents, and otherwise tries to be self-
   explanatory with sufficient descriptions of the intended behavior.
   Similarly, configuration data value constraints and default values,

   where used, are based on recommendations in current standards
   documentation.  Since implementations vary widely in this respect,
   this version of the model specifies only a limited set of defaults
   and ranges with the expectation of being more prescriptive in future
   versions based on actual operator use.

   Note that this version of the model is a work-in-progress in several
   respects.  Although we present a complete framework for MPLS and
   traffic engineering from an operational perspective, some signaling
   protocol configuration will be completed in future revisions.  In
   addition, operational state data for MPLS LSPs is not included in
   this version, but will be added in the next revision.

2.  Model overview

   The overall MPLS model is defined across several YANG modules and
   submodules but at a high level is organized into 3 main sections:

   o  global -- configuration affecting MPLS behavior which exists
      independently of the underlying signaling protocol or label
      switched path configuration.

   o  signaling protocols -- configuration specific to signaling
      protocols used to setup and manage label switched paths.

   o  label switched paths -- configuration specific to instantiating
      and managing individual label switched paths.

   The top level of the model is shown in the tree view below:

   +--rw mpls!
         +--rw global
         |     ...
         +--rw signaling-protocols
         |     ...
         +--rw lsps
               ...

2.1.  MPLS global overview

   The global section of the framework provides configuration control
   for MPLS items which exist independently of an individual label
   switched path or signaling protocol.  These standalone items are
   applicable to the entire logical routing device, and establish
   fundamental configuration such as specific device interfaces where
   MPLS forwarding will be permitted.  Timers are also specified which
   determine the length of time an LSP must be present before considered
   viable for forwarding use (mpls-lsp-install-delay), and the length of

   time between LSP teardown and removal of the LSP from the network
   element's forwarding information base (mpls-lsp-cleanup- delay).
   Also specified are the name to value mappings of MPLS administrative
   groups (mpls-admin-groups).

              |  +--rw interface-admin-groups*  -> /mpls/global/...
              +--rw mpls-lsp-install-delay?   uint16
              +--rw mpls-lsp-cleanup-delay?   uint16
              +--rw mpls-admin-groups* [admin-group-name]
                 +--rw admin-group-name     string
                 +--rw admin-group-value?   uint32

2.2.  Signaling protocol overview

   The signaling protocol section of the framework provides
   configuration elements for configuring three major methods of
   signaling label switched paths: RSVP, segment routing, and label
   distribution protocol (LDP).  Configuration of RSVP is centered
   around interfaces on the device which participate in the protocol.  A
   key focus is to expose common RSVP configuration parameters which are
   used to enhance scale and reliability (refresh-reduction, refresh-
   reduction-reliable).  From the same principles, configuration is
   available to configure the sensitivity of IGP flooding events upon
   bandwidth change on an RSVP interface (ted-update-threshold).  Also
   specified are options to configure RSVP soft-preemption (soft-
   preemption), and for MPLS protection (link-protection).

   Containers for specifying signaling via segment routing and LDP are
   also present.  Specific subelements will be added for those
   protocols, as well as for BGP labeled unicast, in the next revision.

2.3.  LSP overview

   This part of the framework contains LSP information.  At the high
   level, LSPs are split into three categories: traffic-engineering-
   capable (constrained-path), non-traffic-engineered determined by the
   IGP (unconstrained-path), and hop-by-hop configured (static).

   +--rw mpls!
         +--rw lsps
            +--rw constrained-path
            |     ...
            +--rw unconstrained-igp
            |     ...
            +--rw static-lsps
                  ...

   The first two categories, constrained-path and unconstrained-path are
   the ones for which multiple signaling protocols exist, and are
   organized in protocol-specific and protocol-independent sections.
   For example, traffic-engineered, constrained path, LSPs may be set up
   using RSVP-TE or segment routing, and unconstrained LSPs that follow
   the IGP path may be signaled with LDP or with segment routing.  IGP-
   determined LSPs may also be signaled by RSVP but this usage is not
   considered in the current version of the model.

   A portion of the data model for constrained path traffic-engineered
   LSPs is shown below:

3.  Example use cases

3.1.  Traffic engineered p2p LSP signaled with RSVP

   A possible scenario may be the establishment of a mesh of traffic-
   engineered LSPs where RSVP signaling is desired, and the LSPs use a
   local constrained path calculation to determine their path.  These
   LSPs would fall into the category of a constrained-path LSP.  The LSP
   will specify the path setup method as RSVP inside the path-setup
   container, indicating the LSP desires RSVP signaling.  The LSP would
   be configured as locally-computed under the path-computation-method
   container, specifying the use of cspf (use-cspf).  Additional
   attributes such as bandwidth (explicit or auto), protection style,
   and placement constraints are available in the path-attributes
   container.

   The structure to support these is shown in the constrained-path
   portion of the data model below:

                     +--rw segment-routing!
                           ...

3.2.  Traffic engineered LSP signaled with SR

   A possible scenario may be the establishment of disjoint paths in a
   network where there is no requirement for per-LSP state to be held on
   midpoint nodes within the network, or RSVP-TE is unsuitable (as
   described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls] and
   [I-D.shakir-rtgwg-sr-performance-engineered-lsps]).  Such LSPs fall
   in the constrained-path category.  Similar to any other traffic
   engineered LSPs, the path computation method must be specified.  Path
   attributes, such as the as lsp- placement-constraints (expressed as
   administrative groups) or metric must be defined.  Finally, the path
   must be specified in a signaling- protocol specific manner
   appropriate for SR.  The same configuration elements from the tree
   above apply in this case, except that path setup is done by the head-
   end by building a label stack, rather than signaled.

3.3.  IGP-congruent LDP-signaled LSP

   A possible scenario may be the establishment of a full mesh of LSPs.
   When traffic engineering is not an objective, no constraints are
   placed on the end-to-end path, and the best- effort path can be setup
   using LDP signaling simply for label distribution.  The LSPs follow
   IGP-computed paths, and fall in the unconstrained-path category in
   the model.  Protocol-specific configuration pertaining to the
   signaling protocol used, such as the FEC definition and metrics
   assigned are in the path- setup-protocol portion of the model.

   The relevant part of the model for this case is shown below:

     +--rw mpls!
           +--rw lsps
              +--rw unconstrained-igp
                 +--rw path-setup-protocol
                    +--rw ldp!
                       +--rw tunnel
                          +--rw tunnel-type?   mplst:tunnel-type
                          +--rw p2p-lsp
                          |  +--rw fec-address*   inet:ip-prefix
                          +--rw p2mp-lsp
                          +--rw mp2mp-lsp

   A common operational issue encountered when using LDP is traffic
   blackholing under the following scenario: when an IGP failure occurs,
   LDP is not aware of it as these are two protocols running
   independently, resulting in traffic blackholing at the IGP failure
   point even though LDP is up and running.  "LDP-IGP synchronization"
   [RFC5443] can be used to cost out the IGP failing point/segment to
   avoid the blackholing issue.  The LDP-IGP synchronization function
   will be incorporated in a future version of this document.

   Note that targeted LDP sessions are not discussed in this use case,
   and will be incorporated as a separate use case in a future version
   of this document.

4.  Security Considerations

   MPLS configuration has a significant impact on network operations,
   and as such any related protocol or model carries potential security
   risks.

   YANG data models are generally designed to be used with the NETCONF
   protocol over an SSH transport.  This provides an authenticated and
   secure channel over which to transfer BGP configuration and
   operational data.  Note that use of alternate transport or data

Internet-Draft               MPLS / TE Model                  March 2015


   encoding (e.g., JSON over HTTPS) would require similar mechanisms for
   authenticating and securing access to configuration data.

   Most of the data elements in the configuration model could be
   considered sensitive from a security standpoint.  Unauthorized access
   or invalid data could cause major disruption.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This YANG data model and the component modules currently use a
   temporary ad-hoc namespace.  If and when it is placed on redirected
   for the standards track, an appropriate namespace URI will be
   registered in the IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].  The MPLS YANG
   modules will be registered in the "YANG Module Names" registry
   [RFC6020].

6.  YANG modules

   The modules and submodules comprising the MPLS configuration and
   operational model are currently organized as depcited below.

   The base MPLS module includes submodules describing the three
   different types of support LSPs, i.e., traffic-engineered
   (constrained-path), IGP congruent (unconstrained-path), and static.
   The signaling protocol specific parts of the model are described in
   separate modules for RSVP, segment routing, and LDP.  As mentioned
   earlier, support for BGP labeled unicast is also planned in a future
   revision.

   A module defining various reusable MPLS types is included, and these
   modules also make use of the standard Internet types, such as IP
   addresses, as defined in RFC 6991 [RFC6991].
